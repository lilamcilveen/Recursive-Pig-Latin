### Recursive-Pig-Latin
This project explores the functional programming paradigm. The idea behind this is to describe "what" each component is to solve the problem, rather than "how" a result may be computed.

The idea behind the functional programming:
 - We start by asking: "What data do I have?" and "How do I want to transform that data to solve the problem at hand?".
 - Functions are the most important part of the program. Instead of telling data to do something, you pass it to a function to do something. 
 - The function doesn't modify the original data, although it may return a modified copy of it. Recursion is awesome!
 - We avoid changing-state and mutable data.
 
How to run:
 - Input the type of pizza you want to order.
 - "cheese", "hawaiian", "combination"

Example:

    Enter a snake case: hey_i_like_pigs_a_lot!
    
    ('eyhay', 'iay', 'ikelay', 'igspay', 'aay', 'ot!lay')
